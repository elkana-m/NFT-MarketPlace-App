Welcome to NFT Soko
--------------------
NFT Soko is a market place for NFT. The users have the ability to view trending collections 
and top sellers of the NFT world. They are also able to buy and sell after viewing 
the ranking and worth of the NFT (increasing/decreasing value).

I used JetPack Compose, a framework or Android modern toolkit 
for building a native UI relying on Kotlin programming language.

"Soko" is a Swahili noun for "Market". It is usually an open air place 
where goods are bought and sold.
